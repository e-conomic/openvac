					<h2>Your hack</h2>
					<div>
					 As a small business owner, I want to import my bank statements into the system, so I can keep track of my income and expenses.
					</div>
					<div>
					 <br/>Based on the story above, your task is to write a small application that:
					</div>
					<ul>
					 <li>Allows the user to upload a CSV file</li>
					 <li>Parses the content</li>
					 <li>Renders the results in a structured manner</li>
					</ul>
					<div>
					 Keep in mind that we do not expect your code to be production ready. What we're looking for is to see if you have the ability to transform a set of user requirements into a working tool, preferably creating some nice and clean code along the way.
					</div>
					<h4>Bonus Points</h4>
					Bonus points are handsomely rewarded for 1) using the <a href="https://github.com/e-conomic/debitoor-api">Debitoor API</a> in your solution and 2) writing tests for your code.
