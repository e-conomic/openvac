					<h4>Your Hack</h4>
					<div>In preparation for our meeting we would like you to create a small application based on the story below.</div>
					<div style="margin: 20px; overflow: auto;">
					 <code>As a small business owner,<br/>
					 &nbsp;I want to import my email contacts into my new invoicing and accounting system (Debitoor),<br/>
					 &nbsp;so I can access them as Customers and send them invoices.</code>
					</div>
					<h5>Acceptance Criteria (What your app should do)</h5>
					<ul>
					 <li>Allow the user to upload a CSV file (e.g. exported contacts from gmail)</li>
					 <li>Parse the content</li>
					 <li>Render the results in a structured manner</li>
					 <li>Create each email contact as a Customer in Debitoor</li>
					</ul>
					<div>
					 Keep in mind that we do not expect your code to be production ready. What we're looking for is to see if you have the ability to transform a set of user requirements into a working tool, preferably creating some nice and clean code along the way.
					</div>
					<h5>Documentation</h5>
					You should find most of what you need to know right here <a href="https://github.com/e-conomic/debitoor-api">here</a> (but do ask if you run into trouble).
